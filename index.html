            <h2>An Intellectual Society of New York City</h2>
            <p>
                Our aim is to foster a collaborative environment in which the arts, the sciences, and philosophy are explored alongside each other, in contrast to the prevailing trends in the world where connective tissue between these areas is thin. We envision transforming the world through the creation of a collective total-work-of-art which results from the weaving of these disparate crafts.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you live in New York City and are interested, please reach out. We are actively growing our community.

                    <p>
                        Are scientific and philosophical theories inherently failed narratives that overgeneralize the particular? — Is any simple notion of realism or skeptical empiricism a tenable alternative given the simultaneous necessity and nebulosity of epistemological commitments? — Is engineering merely an application of theory that makes compromises with reality along the way or is there an immanence between the two?

                    <p>How are ethics compatible with transgression after the death of God? — What is it that an artist must renounce in the course of his artistic duty, when in a certain sense the artist must embrace the entire world as his canvas? — Are artists in some sense destinied to be the enemies of the average man? — A discourse with Blake, Nietzsche, Wagner, Kant, Lacan, De Sade and Kanye West</p>

                    <p>
                        What if the traumas we associate with modernity and the "West" are the result of the eighth-century split between the Catholic and the Orthodox church? — Can we use the history of the Orthodox Church to carve a path out of the aporia we face today between nihilist libidinal acceleration on one hand and regressive "trad" neoreaction on the other? — Is there a missing divine feminine left out of the standard Christian Trinity of Father, Holy Ghost, and Jesus Christ?
